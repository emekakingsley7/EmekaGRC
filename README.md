## Projects

### Deploying a Secure and Highly Available Web Architecture on AWS

**Description**: Designed and deployed a multi-AZ secure web application on AWS

**Skills Demonstrated**:
- Used Security Groups, NACLs, and IAM roles/policies for access control
- Relied on the Auto scaling, elastic load balancer, and Multi-AZ RDS to make the applications redundant
- Enables CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and S3 logging for monitoring

**Implementation Details**:
- Spin up VPC with public and private subnets across two AZs
- The EC2 instances were configured behind Application Load Balancers to ensure appropriate scaling
- Deployed the RDS MySQL in a Multi-AZ to maintain reliability
- Used S3 bucket to store server access logs
- Configured IAM roles to ensure  they comply with least-privilege principles
- Finally, used CloudTrail and CloudWatch for alerting and monitoring

**Results**:
- Created baseline metrics for ongoing security improvements


### Basic Infrastructure Deployment on AWS using Terraform


**Description**: This project provisions and manages AWS infrastructure using Terraform. The infrastructure includes resources such as EC2 instances, VPC, and more. The goal is to provide a scalable, secure, and efficient cloud environment for deploying applications and services.

**Skills Demonstrated**:
- Set-up and configuration of VS Code
- Terraform set-up and configuration
- How to commit code using GitHub Actions

**Implementation Details**:
- EC2 Instances: Configured Virtual servers to run applications.
- VPC and Subnets: Network infrastructure for resource isolation and security.
- Security Groups: Set up firewall rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.
- NAT and Internet Gateways: For internet access and control of traffic to and from the network
